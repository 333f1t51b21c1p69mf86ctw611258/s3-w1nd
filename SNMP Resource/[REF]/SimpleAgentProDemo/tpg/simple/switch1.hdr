# Description:        This is the var file for the 
#                     layer of switches.
#
#                     This switch is assumed to be
#                     connected to 50 hosts below
#                     it, and a router above it.
#                     
#                     The Switches's own IP address is one of
#                     87.2.2.1....87.2.101.1 if it is connected
#                     to 87.1.2.1 router, and its Mac is 
#                     one of 0x010302020101 ..0x010302650101
#                     or
#                     87.3.2.1....87.3.101.1 if it is connected
#                     to 87.1.3.1 router, and its Mac is 
#                     one of 0x010303020101 ..0x010303650101
#                     or
#                     87.51.1.1....87.51.100.1 if it is connected
#                     to 87.1.51.1 router, and its Mac is 
#                     one of 0x010333020101 ..0x010333650101
#
#                     It is connected to 50 hosts with
#                     IPs 87.2.2.3....87.2.2.53 or
#                         87.3.2.3....87.3.2.53 or

#                     To have only 5 hosts instead of 50, change
#                     51 to 6 in the range specification and ifNum
# 
#                     This assumes that it has 10 vlans, each with
#                     5 hosts on 5 consequtive ports.
